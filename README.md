Fractals and Python
===============================

Repository of the presentation * Painting the chaos with Python * for PyCon Colombia 2018.
This contains multiple examples for the generation of fractals, the code is from different authors and some of its own,
This is just a basic guide, feel free to modify, add and add new examples to the reposotorio

The Python version is:

```
Python 3.6.0 of the installation of Anaconda 4.3.1
```

Previous Definitions
--------------------

+ tdemo_###: Example code for the Python suite
+ size, side, length: It is the number of pixels from one side of the fractal   
+ level, order, profundidad, iterations: number of times a recursive call of a function is made
+ langle, rangle: left angle, right angle
+ For L-System:
    - Alphabet: consists of the valid characters that can be included
    - axiom: statement describing the initial state of the system.
    - target: characters that can be replace 
    - replace: it apply rules to replace the axiom and then applied recursively

Deterministic fractals 
--------------------
+ Tree fractal
+ Barnsley
+ set Cantor
+ dragon fractal and JPdragon
+ Hilbert curve
+ Snowflake of koch
+ Sierpinski fractal

Stochastic Fractals
--------------------
+ Folder Sierpinski: different implementations of the Sierpinski fractal
+ Folder Julia: different implementations of the Julia fractal
+ Folder Mandelbrot: different implementations of the Mandelbrot fractal
+ Folder examples_Ludger_Sandig: code for free software Apollon, for generate Apollonian Gaskets
